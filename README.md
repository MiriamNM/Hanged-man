# Hanged-man ðŸŽ®

Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

This time the game was made in python, where you have to guess the word and you have only 5 attempts to achieve it.
